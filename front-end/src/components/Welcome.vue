        <p>The Logan Glass family reunion website was created to help the family communicate and build relationships.  As we know some of our family members do not have social media.  This site will be used to share some updates and information with all members of the family.</p>
        <p>The family is also looking to update some technology and begin to use online registration so that we can have up-to-date contact information for the members within the family.  This site is geared to confirm attendence, accept payment, and contain reunion information.</p>
